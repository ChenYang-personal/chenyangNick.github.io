## Research Experience

My research focuses on embedding models and Named Entity Recognition (NER) systems, exploring the capabilities of models like BERT, T5, and GPT-2 with datasets such as IMDb, Yelp, and arXiv. I have analyzed how general and specific instruction prompts influence model performance, demonstrating minimal impact on accuracy. A significant part of my work involves designing a benchmark for Closed Domain NER using the BIRD-Bench dataset to extract and link entities from SQL queries. By fine-tuning T5 for NER tasks, I achieved high precision, recall, and F1-scores on custom benchmarks, and evaluated other NER models like Flair and Luke to assess classification performance using metrics such as Seqeval. This research contributes to advancing NER and embedding model performance and was recognized with a proposal selected for presentation at Ontario Database Day 2024.

## Projects

### Image Captioning System

I developed an advanced image captioning system by utilizing Inception V3 for feature extraction and LSTM/GRU for sequence generation. Using the Flickr_8K dataset, I trained and evaluated the model's performance using BLEU scores and semantic distance metrics. To further enhance caption quality, I fine-tuned a large language model (BLIP) and compared its results with those generated by traditional sequence models, demonstrating significant improvements.

### Sentiment Analysis on Boeing Stock

This project focused on analyzing the impact of expert sentiments on Boeing's stock price. I collected and processed over 100 news articles to derive sentiment scores using TextBlob and employed autoregression techniques to predict sentiment trends. The analysis uncovered a strong correlation between sentiment scores and stock price movements, showcasing the significant influence of public sentiment on financial performance.
